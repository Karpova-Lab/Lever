This is the documentation for building a lever for rat behavioral experiments. 
This project was developed in the [Karpova Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/karpova-lab) at Janelia Research Campus.

## Features

- Extends and retracts depending on input signal
- Outputs signal when lever is pressed or released
- [pyControl](https://pycontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/hardware/#behaviour-ports) compatible
- Durable - faceplate and lever are made of aluminum
- Fast - 180ms to extend or retract
- All files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Karpova-Lab/nosepoke)  and can be modified to meet custom needs
